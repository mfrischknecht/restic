Enhancement: Allow multiple parent snapshots in the backup command

Restic used to take the latest snapshot with identical paths as
parent snapshots. This is now enhanced and multiple parent snapshots
can be specified. Restic also by default uses more than one snapshot
as parent, when this is appropriate, e.g. if subdirs of a newly backed-up
dir already exist in previous snapshots.
