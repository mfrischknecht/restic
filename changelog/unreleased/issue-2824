Bugfix: Treat superseded index files correctly

We've fixed the treatment of still existing superseded index files.

Index files that have been superseded are usually removed directly. However, if this
wasn't the case, restic used them like normal index files without warning.
This could result in data loss in special circumstances.
The treatment of this special situation has been fixed and restic check was changed
to warn if "obsolete" index files are present in the repo.
